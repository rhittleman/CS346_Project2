# CS346_Project2

Game Idea: Rock Paper Siccors Lizard Spock
Partner 1: Ryan Hittleman
Partner 2: Benhur Tadiparti

This main goal for this project was to have 2 servers mirroring eachother, while being connected to one database that stores a player's private data.
By using Flask, we wanted our python code to do most of the heavy lifting as we were asked to leave our html statless. Hence, our html pages were just the layouts for the web pages,
while our python files were communicating between the database and the html pages. Push/pull data from the html page and push/pull into the database.
